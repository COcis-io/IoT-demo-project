# Objectives

In this step, we will add Docker Compose to the picture and define the multi containers application

# Instructions

* Create a docker-compose.yml file defining both services (*db* and *api*)
* *db*: defines the *influxdata* volume and mount it on /var/lib/influxdb
* *db*: use the influxdb.conf file present locally
* *db*: export both 8083 and 8086 ports
* *api*: use "db" as the default InfluxDB host
* *api*: use the build instruction to easily rebuild the application image while in development environment
* *api*: export port 3000
 
Below is an example of the docker-compose.yml file:

````
version: "3.1"
services:
  db:
    image: influxdb
    command: -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf
    ports:
      - 8083:8083
      - 8086:8086
    volumes:
      - influxdata:/var/lib/influxdb
      - ./influxdb.conf:/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf
  api:
   image: iot:v2
   build: ./nodejs
   command: npm start
   ports:
     - 3000:3000
volumes:
  - influxdata
````

# Running the application

With this compose file created, the application can be ran easily with the following command

````
docker-compose up
````

From the output we can see the creation of several components
* the user defined bridge network the containers will be connected to
* the volume defined to handle InfluxDB data
* the services' containers, *db* and *api*

````
Creating network "step5_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "step5_influxdata" with default driver
Creating step5_api_1
Creating step5_db_1
Attaching to step5_db_1, step5_api_1

Note: when running a Docker Compose application, the containers can communicate together only by using the name of the service, this is the reason why the InfluxDB host defined in the *api* can be referenced with "db". The creation of a user-defined bridge network enables this communication by name.

# Test

As a new instance of InfluxDB as been created, we need to create our *iot* database first. This time we will create it using the administration interface available on port 8083.

![Influxdb admin](./images/influxdb-iot-creation.png)

Once again, let's test the application with the following curl command. If everything is fine, a 201 HTTP Status Code should be returned, and an info message should be added in the *api* logs.

````
curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"ts":"2017-03-07T23:12:52Z", "type": "temp", "value": 34, "sensor_id": 123 }' http://localhost:3000/data
